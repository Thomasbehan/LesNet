## Data
The DataScraper tool within this application is designed to download and preprocess skin lesion images from the ISIC Archive for use in machine learning projects. The images
are stored in three separate directories for training, validation, and testing, featuring a total of 40,194 images. This substantial dataset aims to provide a comprehensive basis for accurate skin lesion analysis and classification.

The data is organised as follows:
- Train: 32,155 images
- Test: 8,039 images

### Data Source
The dataset used for training the model is sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) Archive. The ISIC Archive is a large-scale resource for skin image analysis, providing open access to a wide variety of images for the development and evaluation of automated diagnostic systems.

For more information about the ISIC Archive and to access the data, visit [ISIC Archive](https://www.isic-archive.com).

### Data Organization
The images are organized into three folders:

1. `data/train`: Contains 80% of the total images, which are used for training the model.
2. `data/test`: Contains 20% of the total images, used for testing the model's performance during and after training.

## Model
The `SkinCancerDetector` model employs a sophisticated deep learning architecture tailored for the accurate classification of skin lesions as benign or malignant. Built on TensorFlow, the model features a sequential arrangement of layers, utilising convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for their powerful image processing capabilities.

### Architecture Overview
The architecture is meticulously designed to capture the intricate patterns and features of skin lesions through multiple stages of convolutional layers, each followed by max pooling to reduce spatial dimensions and dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The model's core is structured as follows:

- **Convolutional Layers:** Multiple layers with ReLU activation to extract features from images.
- **Max Pooling Layers:** Applied after convolutional layers to reduce the size of the feature maps, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computation in the network.
- **Dropout Layers:** Used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time.
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers that learn non-linear combinations of the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers.
- **Output Layer:** A dense layer with a sigmoid activation function to classify the input image as benign or malignant.

### Training and Optimization
The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, which are well-suited for binary classification tasks. It leverages metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to evaluate performance throughout the training process.

Training involves the use of a data generator for efficient handling of large image datasets, augmenting the training data to improve generalization. The model also incorporates callbacks for early stopping, learning rate reduction on plateau, and model checkpointing to save the best-performing model.

This advanced architecture and training regimen enable the `SkinCancerDetector` to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between benign and malignant skin lesions, making it a valuable tool for aiding in the early detection of skin cancer.


## Performance
The updated model demonstrates significant improvements in its ability to classify skin lesions accurately, achieving an accuracy of 84% and a loss of 0.23 on the testing dataset. The model's sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score have also seen considerable enhancements, with the following scores reported on the testing dataset:

- Sensitivity: 84.035%
- Specificity: 84.019%
- Precision: 84.035%
- F1 Score: 84.467%
- Accuracy: 84.035%
- Loss: 0.23201
- AUC: 91.692%
