## Roadmap

This development roadmap is designed to iteratively enhance capabilities, focusing on improving its accuracy, scalability, and robustness. Each model iteration (M1 through M5) represents a step forward. Here's an overview of the planned roadmap:

### M1: Proof of Concept
- **Objective:** Establish a foundational AI model using the ViT (Vision Transformer) as a base. The primary aim is to set up the necessary tools and framework for AI development within our project.
- **Dataset:** 10,000~ images
- **Focus:** Laying down the groundwork for future iterations by validating the initial model architecture and data processing pipelines.

### M2: Initial Deployment
- **Objective:** Build upon the proof of concept by increasing the dataset size and refining the model based on initial learnings.
- **Dataset:** 40,194 images
- **Focus:** Enhance model accuracy and establish a benchmark for performance improvements in subsequent versions.

### M3: Expanded Dataset
- **Objective:** Further increase the dataset size to improve the model's ability to generalize and accurately identify skin cancer from a wider variety of images.
- **Dataset:** 52,379 images, 28 Categories
- **Focus:** Target substantial improvements in model performance, particularly in handling diverse and challenging cases.

### M4: Advanced Features and Security
- **Objective:** Implement a new Duel model approach one model processing images and the other a natural language model processing a contextual conversational about these images. 
- **Dataset:** 200k~ Images, TBD
- **Focus:** Focusing on improving the model with a bigger improved dataset, natural language capabilities and moving to a duel model approach.

### M5: TBD
